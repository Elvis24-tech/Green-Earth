## 🌿 Project Description
This project is a responsive, multi-section website layout developed for **Web Design and Development: Assignment 2**. The goal of this project was to demonstrate proficiency in structuring a webpage using semantic HTML `<div>` containers and styling it with an external CSS stylesheet.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture
The project follows the "Holy Grail" layout requirement as specified in the assignment prompt:

* **Header:** Branding and site title.
* **Navigation Menu:** A sticky menu featuring internal anchor links.
* **Three-Column Main Section:**
    * **Sidebar (Left):** Quick links and navigation.
    * **Main Content (Center):** Detailed information with styled imagery.
    * **Sidebar (Right):** Statistical data and project highlights.
* **Footer:** Contact information and copyright.

## 🚀 Features
* **Responsive Design:** Utilizes **CSS Grid** to manage a three-column layout that remains stable across different viewing contexts.
* **Internal Navigation:** Integrated anchor tags (`#`) allow for smooth-scroll navigation within the single-page interface.
* **External Styling:** All visual presentation is handled via `style.css`, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.
* **Styled Media:** Images are optimized with responsive widths, rounded corners, and shadow effects for a professional UI.
